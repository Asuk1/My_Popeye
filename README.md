What is the project
The project is an Epitech DevOps project that will introduce you to one of the most importantnotions of DevOps: containerization.

The goal
You will create several images using Dockerfiles and coordinate their creation and deployment using Docker Compose.
In the end, with a simple one-line command, you will be able to deploy a fully containerized set of applications together, anytime, anywhere, without the needto switch between operating systems to make everything work.

Why the project
It's an project prior to "pain au chcolatine" (another DevOps project in my private Repositeries) that I could not do  beacause they did not want to force-registering me for this project.
So I wanted to do it my self for my self-teaching.
