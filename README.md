# What is the project

The project is an Epitech DevOps project that will introduce you to one of the most importantnotions of DevOps: containerization.


# The goal

You will create several images using Dockerfiles and coordinate their creation and deployment using Docker Compose.
In the end, with a simple one-line command, you will be able to deploy a fully containerized set of applications together, anytime, anywhere, without the needto switch between operating systems to make everything work.


# Why the project

It's an project prior to "pain au chcolatine" (another DevOps project in my private Repositeries) that I could not do  beacause they did not want to force-registering me for this project.
So I wanted to do it my self for my self-teaching.

# Activity

In pause since June. Will continue it when I will find a stage
